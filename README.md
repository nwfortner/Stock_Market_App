# Stock_Market_App

This is a Web site for you to monitor stocks. The website comes pre-loaded with six stocks for you to monitor which you can change by clicking on the stock symbol and entering a new stock symbol into the prompt. Along with the stock ticker information for your stocks you get a news feed and a video feed for each specific stock. The stock ticker info is pulled from the Yahoo Finance Api and the news and video feed data is pulled from the Bing Search Api.
